# Codecademy Mixed Messages Project
This is a project for Codecademy's Mixed Message project assessment, which can be found [here](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/back-end-engineer/paths/becj-22-software-engineering-foundations/tracks/becj-22-portfolio-project-mixed-messages/modules/becp-22-mixed-messages-6528be67-e116-4f3e-a868-f1bbd673b4f8/kanban_projects/mixed-messages "Will need Codecademy account to view").

#### Project objectives
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
- Output a randomised message with at least three different peices of data forming the output.
- Use Git version control.
- Use command line.
- Develop locally on your computer

#### What will the project do?
This is a message generator program. Every time the program is run, the user will get a new randomised output. This message will be made up of different parts which combine to the final message.

I intend to create a classpect and land generator in the style of those found in the webcomic [homestuck](https://homestuck.net/). This will take the form of:

"You are a CLASS of ASPECT and your land is the Land Of THING1 and THING2"

E.g. "You are a Knight of Blood and your land is the Land of Pulse and Haze"

The type of land words that the reader can recieve will be determined by the aspect that you have randomly drawn.
